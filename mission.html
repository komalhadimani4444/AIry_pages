    <h3>About the Game</h3>
    <p>The game basically focuses on help improving decision making for autism children. It gives a small paragraph
      that contains some
      emotion and feelings and there will be two options, out of which the children have to choose the correct feeling
      or
      emotion. This will
      eventually help them to improve their decision making skills and overcome the syndrome.

    <h3> How our game helps children and parents? </h3>
    <p>Since most of the autistic children struggle with making decisions or choosing the right emotions.
      So our game provides an platform to solve this issue with fun. ALso we are using google actions interactive

      recognition in daily life.
      Moreover are helping parents to teach their autistic children in a good way so that they know more about their
      child and help them with autism.
